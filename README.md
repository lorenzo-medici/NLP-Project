# NLP-Project

## Project structure

Notes in all files
The directory contains a copy of the external GitHub repo, converted to python 3.
I (Lorenzo) will clean it and take care of the first and last methods to implement.

When adding dependencies you should run `pipreqs . --force` from the root directory, after installing it with `pip install pipreqs`.

### Notes

- Sentence pairs 99 and 129 removed from dataset because they do not belong in it (source https://semanticsimilarity.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/trmmucca20131_12.pdf)
